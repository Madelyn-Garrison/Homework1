    "text": "Below are my answers to the data science vs statistics questions.\n\n\nI typically think of a data scientist as an individual that handles the programming required to manage a large amount of data. I imagine them as some type of contracter or consultant for another company.\n\n\nThere is a large overlap between the fields of data science and statistics. Both groups use the same programming languages and analyze data. However, in data science there is a greater emphasis on programming, while in statistics there is greater emphasis on the underlying mathematical principles.\n\n\nAs a statistics student, I identify more as a statistician, given the courses I have taken in statistical theory. However, the technology associated with the field of data science allows for so much analysis to be done on such a large scale that most statisticians probably consider themselves somewhat of a data scientist, and vice versa."
